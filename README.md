## The Magic of Pairing Launix with n8n Automation

n8n automation supercharges Launix:

- **Connect modules across the board** — trigger Launix actions automatically (create customers, send documents, update opportunities).
- **Leverage Launix’s database schemes and views** — pull live, structured data directly from Launix, process or enrich it with n8n, and feed results back automatically. This enables real-time dashboards, intelligent notifications, and complex cross-system workflows.
- **Save time with zero-code workflows** — chain actions like “new lead → CRM tag → automated email → project creation” without coding.
- **Combine custom actions** — integrate Launix’s unique capabilities (e.g., `Invoice-Send`) into multi-step workflows involving email, chat apps, or external APIs.
- **Scale complexity gradually** — start with simple automations, then expand to orchestrate advanced, multi-branch business processes.

**💡 Why it’s cool:**  
Launix gives you a flexible, database-driven backbone with rich API access. n8n acts as the automation glue, turning Launix’s structured data and actions into smart, responsive workflows. Together, they deliver unmatched efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.
